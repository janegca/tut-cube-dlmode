using CUBE methodology

## Suggested Improvements:

You can also improve this system further. A couple of quick ideas are:

- Observe changes to the userâ€™s dark/light mode setting, probably via the
  prefers-color-scheme media query and update the default state accordingly
- Refactor the CSS theming to not repeat itself as much. I personally would roll
  out some Sass for this situation
